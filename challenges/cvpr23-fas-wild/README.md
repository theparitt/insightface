## Challenge

We host the WILD track of Face Anti-spoofing Workshop and Challenge@CVPR2023 here. The challenge will officially start together with [4th Face Anti-spoofing Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/face-anti-spoofing-challenge/welcome/challengecvpr2023). [Registration](#) will open soon on codalab.

### Rules and Regulations

1) Any extra data or pretrained model trained from extra data cannot be used in this challenge.

2) Only one DL model can be used, we can not accept the fusion results from many DL models. The computational cost of a single DL model should be **less than 5G FLOPs**. 

3) The top-3 winners are required to submit the code for the entire method, ensuring reproducibility of the results and compliance with all contest rules, otherwise the score will be disqualified.

## Dataset

### Rules

1. The dataset and its subsets can only be used for academic research purposes.
2. The user is not allowed to use the dataset or its subsets for any type of commercial purpose.

5. The user is not allowed to share, transfer, sell or resell the dataset or its subsets to any third party for any purpose. HOWEVER, providing the dataset access to user’s research associates, colleagues or team member is allowed if user’s research associates, colleagues or team member agree to be bound by these usage rules.
6. All images in this dataset can be used for academic research purposes, BUT, only the approved images of the dataset can be exhibited on user’s publications(including but not limited to research paper, presentations for conferences or educational purposes). The approved images have special marks and are listed in a appendix.
7. We reserve the right to interpret and amend these rules.

### Download

All users can obtain and use this dataset and its subsets only after signing the Agreement and sending it to the official e-mail ``insightface.challenge#gmail.com``.


### Data Collection

We hired 8 collectors to collect spoof data from web search-engine and another 10 annotators to define labeling for all data.  As the result, we have totally xxx spoof images in xxx categories and xxx live images with no categorization.


### Dataset Annotations

Please refer to the following table for detailed information on the number of labeled data in the dataset:

#### Spoofing Images:


#### Live Images:
