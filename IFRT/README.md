# InsightFace Recognition Test
**IFRT** is a globalised fair benchmark for face recognition algorithms. IFRT evaluates the algorithm performance on worldwide web pictures which contain various sex, age and race groups, but no identification photos.

Similar to [FRVT](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt), we encourage participants to prepare a black-box feature extractor. To simplify this process, users can just replace their trained ArcFace model(with or without encryption) in our simple open-sourced pre-packaged software.

Submitting features is also allowed, you can send an e-mail to us to request the test image set, with a promise not to redistribute it.
