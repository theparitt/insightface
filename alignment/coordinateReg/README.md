### Introduction

 Here we provide some landmark prediction models with fast coordinate regression comparing with heatmap based methods. 
 The input of these models is usually loose cropped face image, and the output is the direct landmark coordinates. 


### Pretrained Models

- **Model 2d106det**

  Given face detection bounding box, predict landmarks. Mainly used for static image inference. Please check ``image_infer.py`` for detail.
