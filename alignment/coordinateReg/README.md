Two 2D-106 pretrained models are provided to predict landmarks by given loose crop face images.

Model ``2d106det``: Given face detection bounding box, predict landmarks.

Model ``2d106track``: Given landmarks bounding box, predict landmarks.

Model ``2d106det`` is usually used for static image inference, while model ``2d106track`` can be used for video landmarks tracking.
